<h1>Why</h1>
<p>We're building a PaaS that tightly integrates with our suite of services, and the rest of our dev-deploy process.</p>
<p>We're open sourcing it so you can build whatever you want too, audit how it works, and be able to see how everything works.</p>
<p>If you don't trust some corporation to host your data but want the convenience and scalability of a continuous deploy PaaS just run it own your own private hardware.</p>
<p>With Aquatic you can easily deploy multiple apps and instances of just about anything you like and wire it all up together using the same -.json file you use to specify your dev environment. The app you write to test locally with <code>Guppy</code>, then deploy using <code>Fishtank</code> can just as easily be deployed and scaled on the <code>Aquatic</code> platform.</p>
