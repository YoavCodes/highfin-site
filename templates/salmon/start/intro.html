<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hi let's get started!</p>

legacy api docs
the entire documentation site is on github.

versioned documentation is available by downloading the site at that tag version and running it yourself.
/api is a living document for the latest changes.

when the api solidifies we'll have a page dedicated to linking to older versions.
