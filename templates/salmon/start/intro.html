<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Salmon is a thick-client Javascript framework backed by a razor-thin node.js server. To help with context switching and code organization the front-end and back-end are namespaced as <code>fin</code> and <code>tail</code>.</p>

<p>It comes packed with a novel way to model and access data on the client, automatic namespacing that lets you organize your code your way, it's own navigation and templating mechanisms, easy cross-browser ajax forms, and more.</p>
