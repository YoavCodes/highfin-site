<p>If you clone the repo then all you need to get started is a recent version of node.js.</p>
<p>We're also building a set of Tools including <code>Guppy</code> (a task runner), and <code>Fishtank</code> and <code>Aquatic</code> (continuous deploy servers) that share a tight integration with each other.</p>
