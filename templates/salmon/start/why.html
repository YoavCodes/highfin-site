<h1>Why</h1>
<p>There are some really cool javascript frameworks out there already, so why create another one?</p>
<p>The existing market can be broken into two segments. Frameworks that work only on the client or only on the server, and full stack frameworks. The client/server only frameworks are fundamentally lacking in how they guide you to think about apps you build with them. Hacking those frameworks to incorporate <code>salmon</code>-like concepts is possible in some cases but messy and requires linking multiple 3rd party libraries together. The fullstack frameworks on the market try to do too much and are too opinionated.</p>

<p>Salmon aims to strike a better balance between speed, ease of reasoning, beautiful code, rich feature set, and automation while maintaining a certain degree of flexibility.</p>
