<h1>NPM</h1>

<p>Any npm libs you need for your app can be specified in <code>/libs/package.js</code> and require as needed in your application code. Your application code goes in the <code>/app</code> folder. Routes, configuration, schemas, and bootstrap functions go in your <code>/config</code> folder. Don't modify any files in the core <code>/node</code> folder, this separation makes it super easy to upgrade your tail server to the latest version of Salmon, simply replace the entire <code>/node</code> folder to upgrade.</p>
