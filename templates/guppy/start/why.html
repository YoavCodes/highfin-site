<h1>Why</h1>
<p>Do we really need another task runner? What does Guppy do differently?</p>
<p>Guppy is written in Go which compiles to a binary. This means it can go places node.js based task runners can't.</p>
<p>At HighFin we use -.json files for everything from dev configuration to deploy configuration. Guppy shares a lot of code with other HighFin projects making it really easy to have one configuration file for every stage of managing your app.</p>
